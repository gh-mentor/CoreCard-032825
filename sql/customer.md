We need help writing a T-SQL script that defines a database schema and tables for a small financial institution's database. 
Details:
- The database stores customer information, account information, transaction information, and credit card information.
- Use 'GO' to separate each action.
- Each table must record the create date and update date.
- Use 'PRINT' to display messages.
- Use 'BEGIN TRY' and 'BEGIN CATCH' for error handling.
