We need help writing a T-SQL script that defines a database schema and tables for a small financial institution's database. 
Details:
- The database will be named 'CreditCareDB' and will store information about customers, accounts, transactions, and credit cards.
- The database will include tables for Customers, Accounts, Transfers (transactions), and Credit Cards.
- Each table will have appropriate primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints to ensure data integrity and relationships between tables.
- The credit card table will contain a unique token or reference provided by the third-party authority for processing transactions.
- Each table must record the create date and update date.
- Use 'GO' to separate each action.
- Use 'PRINT' to display messages.
- Use 'BEGIN TRY' and 'BEGIN CATCH' for error handling.
